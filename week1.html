      <h3>A TRIBUTE TO CHINUA ACHEBE</h3>

      <p>
        Chinua Achebe is unquestionably one of the outstanding and best-known
        writers to have emerged from colonial and independent Africa. He is a
        social critic and political activist of an egalitarian bent.<br /><br />
        As a writer, he has many novels and nonfiction works to his credit, the
        most famous of which is Things Fall Apart. This I have taken as the
        representative text of his work. It is widely acclaimed in Africa,
        Europe, and the Americas as his masterpiece. He is a staunch advocate,
        among others, of an African using his former colonial master’s language
        as his means of expression, to use it in such a manner as to give his
        creative writing an authentic African stamp. This he has done
        successfully in the novel Things Fall Apart. Herein lies its universal
        acclaim: the telling impact it has had on world literature. It is
        difficult to know where to begin to pay tribute to the Eagle on the
        Iroko, but fortunately he gave me “a mouth with which to tell my story.”
        He unchained my African tongue from its colonial hinges, so I could
        confidently say “My spirit tells me” instead of “I have a hunch.” Chinua
        Achebe has to his credit more than thirty published works of fiction,
        poetry, children’s literature, non-fiction and critical essays including
        the recently published There Was a Country.<br /><br />
        A Personal History of Biafra, which have continued to shape the
        trajectory of African literature around the world. Even more
        fascinating, was his invention of a new dialect of English which many
        African writers adopted for their fiction. So today, three days after
        the news spread to the whole world that Omenka, the master artist, has
        breathed his last, my spirit tells me: All is well; the master still
        lives.
